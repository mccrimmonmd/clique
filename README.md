An abstract, experimental videogame meant to evoke the feeling of being alone while surrounded by people.  Programmed using Python 2 and PyGame. Hendrix College senior project.

For illustrative purposes, three versions are presented:

Version 1 contains my first attempt at a decision algorithm for the game’s NPCs (shapes). This intricate, detailed algorithm reliably made every shape move up and to the left, all the time, every time.

Version 2 overhauled the first decision algorithm, speeding up the game’s code and producing much more interesting behavior.  Various other tweaks were applied.

Version 3 switched from color to shades of gray, in an attempt to make the intended meaning clearer to the player by simplifying gameplay.  Various other tweaks were applied.

All three versions require PyGame (https://www.pygame.org/) to run.  Unfortunately, I neglected to document which version I used, so now (in 2017) I have no idea what version(s) this code will work with :-/
